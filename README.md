# 3D Urban Modelling - Lisbon Neighborhood
**Institution**: Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade de Lisboa  
**Course**: 3D Urban Modelling  
**Project Date**: 2022  
**Project Language**: Portuguese

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a 3D urban model of a neighborhood in Lisbon, based on data from prior photogrammetry and cartography projects. The goal was to represent the neighborhood using **CityEngine**, generating buildings, roads, and urban features with different levels of detail. Although the ESRI webscene used to display the model is no longer available, the project can be run locally using CityEngine.

## Skills and Tools Used
- **Software**: CityEngine, ArcGIS, QGIS
- **Languages**: CGA rules
- **Techniques**: 3D modeling, photogrammetry, stereorestitution, georeferencing

## Key Results
The project produced a 3D model of Lisbon's neighborhood, highlighting:
- Buildings at **LOD 2** (Level of Detail), including variations in roof types and facades.
- Detailed streets and vegetation modeled using CGA rules.
- Limitations in rendering due to processing constraints.

### Key Features:
- Generated topologies of urban elements, including roads and vegetation.
- Custom CGA rules were written for generating buildings and adding textures.
